What DataValidator vs DataCleaner (quality_checker) REALLY do
🔍 Short answer

They do different jobs on purpose.

Component	What it does	Touches data?
DataValidator	Finds problems	❌ NO
DataCleaner (quality_checker)	Fixes problems	✅ YES
🩺 DataValidator = Doctor (Diagnosis)

Purpose:
👉 Look at the data and report issues, nothing more.

Examples of what a validator does:

“This column has missing values”

“This column has mixed data types”

“This column has outliers”

“This column has low variance”

Key rule:

Validators must NEVER change data

Why?

So users can see problems before fixing

So you can generate cleaning recommendations

So you can build trust

Think:

A doctor examines you and writes a report — they don’t perform surgery immediately.

🧹 DataCleaner (quality_checker) = Janitor / Surgeon (Action)

Purpose:
👉 Fix specific problems when the user asks.

Examples:

Remove duplicates

Fill missing values

Remove outliers

Standardize text

Convert types

Remove low-variance columns

Key rule:

Cleaners always modify data

Think:

Surgery only happens after diagnosis and consent.
