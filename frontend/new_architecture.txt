    1. Learning Goals System 📚
What it does:

Teaches data science concepts as users work
Shows tooltips, explanations, and tutorials
Tracks learning progress
Provides interactive lessons

Example User Experience:
User: "What are outliers?"
    ↓
AI: "Great question! Let me show you..."
    [Opens interactive tutorial]
    [Shows real examples from their data]
